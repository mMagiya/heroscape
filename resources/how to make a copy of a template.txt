1. Copy [gamename].mse-game and rename as desired
2. Copy any [gamename]-[templatename].mse-style folders as desired and rename to match the new name (newgamename)
3. In [newgamename].mse-game/game and /keywords, update all references to [gamename] to the new name (newgamename)
4. In any [newgamename]-[templatename].mse-style/style files, update all references to [gamename] to the new name (newgamename)

Changing the version number for the game type can be done, but requires updating references to that version number in all files
Backing up existing files by selecting them all, right clicking, and selecting "send to compressed/zipped folder" is recommended before making changes
